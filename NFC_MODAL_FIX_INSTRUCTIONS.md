# NFCModal Fix Instructions for Junior Developer

## Problem
When logging in as `evanlee@gmail.com`, the NFCModal shows `someone@example.com` instead of the correct email, and facial recognition doesn't work properly.

## Solution
Replace the existing NFCModal.jsx file with the updated version.

## Steps for Junior Developer:

### 1. File Replacement
- **File to replace:** `eazygame/src/components/NFCModal/NFCModal.jsx`
- **Action:** Replace the entire file with the new version provided

### 2. What was Fixed
- ✅ Fixed user ID to email mapping
- ✅ Added better debugging logs
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Added proper string conversion for user ID lookup

### 3. Test the Fix
1. Login as `evanlee@gmail.com` with password `password2`
2. Open NFCModal (facial recognition feature)
3. Check browser console (F12) - should show:
   ```
   getCurrentUser() returned: 2
   User ID mapping: {currentUserId: 2, mappedEmail: "evanlee@gmail.com", ...}
   Current user email for recognition: evanlee@gmail.com
   ```
4. The modal should now show `evanlee@gmail.com` instead of `someone@example.com`
5. Facial recognition should look for `evan.jpg` in the identity folder

### 4. Required Files (Make sure these exist)
- `eazygame/src/assets/identity/evan.jpg` ✅
- `eazygame/src/assets/identity/leow.jpg` ✅  
- `eazygame/src/assets/identity/shilin.jpg` ✅

### 5. If Still Not Working
Check browser console for these debug messages:
- What user ID is stored: `localStorage.getItem('user_id')`
- What email is being mapped: Look for "User ID mapping" log
- What photo file is being looked for: Look for "Current user email for recognition" log

## Expected Result
- ✅ `evanlee@gmail.com` login → Shows `evanlee@gmail.com` in NFCModal
- ✅ `lsheang@yahoo.com` login → Shows `lsheang@yahoo.com` in NFCModal  
- ✅ `shilin@gmail.com` login → Shows `shilin@gmail.com` in NFCModal
- ✅ Facial recognition works for all three users

**Note:** This fix ensures the user ID to email mapping works correctly for all users in the system.
